# UWMadCS760
This is a collection of several projects done for UW Madison CS 760 (Machine Learning) during Spring 2023

Each folder includes:

1) PDF file for the HW questions
2) Several jupyter notebooks(the name of each notebook correlates to the question and question part answered in the hw pdf)
3) data zip file that contains all the data used by the jupyter notebooks

In these projects I implemented various ML algorithms from scratch including neural nets, linear svm, kernel svm, log reg, KmeansGMM, PCA, and Naive Bayes and trained/tested/compared them with actual datasets.
